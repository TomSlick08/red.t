#Comprehensive Lab - Red.t

We've learned a ton about The Agile Process, Test-Driven Development, Ruby on Rails,  HTML & CSS over the past few weeks. Before we move on to JavaScript, we wanted to give you guys an opportunity to put all of these skills together on a new project to really solidify them.


The app concept is called Red.t. It is a link sharing app that allows users to submit links to be shared with other users. Users can upvote and downvote links, and the most popular links get bubbled to the top. The concept is based off of Reddit or Hacker News.

There is a rough list of user stories for this app here and also below:

We will be taking questions for additional requirements gathering and clarification.

#### Notes

* We will be working on this lab over the next few days.
* You will be pair-programming.
* Create this project in a new public repo (Not in our class repo)
* Add us all as collaborators on your repos
* Make frequent commits
* Make ERD's for all of your entities before you begin to code.


#### User Stories

- User can login/logout
	- As a user I want to authenticate myself with the server so that other users can't submit stories as me.
- User can submit a link
	- As a user I want to submit a link so that i can share sweet stuff I found on the web with Red.t users 
	- All URL's should be unique
- User can see a list of submitted links
	- As a user I want to see a list of all links submitted so that I can consume more internets 
- User can view profiles
	- As a user I want to be able to see other users submissions so that I can see if they have posted things I like 

##### Backlog - Think about implementation
- User can comment on a link
